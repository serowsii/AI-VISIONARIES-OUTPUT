 Introduction
Generative AI systems, particularly text-based models, have gained prominence for their ability to generate human-like text. However, these systems often mirror and perpetuate existing biases. A notable gender gap exists in the adoption of such AI tools, with men more likely to explore and use them compared to women. This disparity has significant implications, affecting both individual opportunities and broader societal progress.

This study seeks to identify the factors contributing to gender disparities in the adoption of text-based Generative AI systems, with a focus on underrepresented populations, particularly women in African countries. By collecting data specific to African users, this project aims to shed light on gender inequality in AI adoption within the region.

 Project Overview
The project explores the adoption rate of Generative AI tools, particularly GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers), focusing on how gender influences usage patterns. The main objectives are:
- To identify predictors of gender disparity in the adoption of text-based Generative AI tools.
- To collect and analyze data from African populations, addressing the lack of representation in AI adoption studies.
- To propose measures to bridge the gender gap in the exploration and use of Generative AI.

 Tools and Technologies Used
- Programming Languages: Python, R
- Data Analysis Libraries: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Survey Tools: Google Forms
- Data Visualization: Power BI
- Natural Language Processing: GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
- Collaboration Platforms: GitHub, Google Drive, CANVA, google meet

 Data Collection
To gather data specific to African populations and their adoption of text-based AI tools, a custom questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire included questions about:
- Demographics: Race, Gender, Age, Location
- Industry: Fields of employment or study
- Awareness and Usage: Whether respondents had heard of or used GPTs or AI in general
- Frequency of AI Use: How often AI tools are used, if at all

Initial feedback revealed that some respondents had never heard of GPT, resulting in incomplete or non-responses. The questionnaire will be iterated to include questions on awareness, and educational resources will be provided to improve future participation.

 Data Analysis Process
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Cleaning incomplete responses, handling missing data, and normalizing categorical variables like gender and race, dropping outliers
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Investigating patterns in AI tool usage by gender, race, and location.
   - Visualizing trends through graphs and summary statistics to reveal any underlying gender gaps.
3. Statistical Analysis:
   - Hypothesis testing to determine the significance of gender, race, and location in AI adoption rates.
   - Regression models to identify predictors of adoption and understand how various factors influence generative AI tool usage.
4. AI Bias Detection:
   - Analyzing AI-generated responses for potential biases in gender representation, focusing on areas where disparities might emerge.

 Challenges and Limitations
- Lack of Awareness: Many respondents had not used or heard of GPTs, limiting the dataset's representativeness.
- Sample Size: Initial data collection was limited, and the research aims to expand the sample size by reaching a more diverse group of respondents across Africa.
- Cultural Differences: Varying levels of AI adoption across African countries might influence results and generalizations.

 Results and Insights
The study revealed a significant gender gap in the adoption of GPT and similar AI tools, with men more likely to have experimented with these technologies compared to women. The lack of representation of African women in AI adoption studies highlights the need for targeted initiatives to raise awareness and engagement.

Key findings include:
- Lower awareness of Generative AI tools among women, particularly in certain African regions.
- Industry-specific trends where men dominate AI tool usage, especially in tech-related fields.
- Societal and cultural factors may play a role in deterring women from exploring these tools.

 Future Work
- Expanded Questionnaire: Refining the questionnaire to include more detailed demographic and industry-related questions, as well as questions that address awareness and exposure to AI technologies.
- Awareness Campaigns: Collaborating with educational institutions and organizations to raise awareness of AI tools among women.
- Further Research: Investigating specific cultural and societal factors that contribute to the gender gap in AI adoption.

 Conclusion
This project highlights the significant gender disparity in the adoption of text-based Generative AI tools, particularly in Africa. The results underscore the need for more inclusive approaches to AI education and adoption to bridge the gap and ensure equal opportunities for women in this evolving technological landscape.
